# Github Practices
This README outlines norms and standards that will get you comfortable with using `git` and [Github](https://github.com/). When creating projects, follow these steps to help get you started:

1. Create a [Github Repository](https://github.com/new) titled: **<your project name\>** and initialize a README
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone <Repository_URL> 
    ```
3. Create and commit a `.gitignore` file containing the following:
    ```
    __pycache__/
    .vscode/
    ```
4. Solve the challenge, creating a commit after adding each requirement
5. Update your README, describing your project in the following format:
    - Project Title
    - Prerequisites
    - Getting Started
    - Running the Application
    - Project Structure
