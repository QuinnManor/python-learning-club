# Fizzbuzz
We've created a Fizzbuzz application a few times, but repition is the father of learning so let's run it back. This time though, the purpose is to get you comfortable with `git` and [Github](https://github.com/). Therefore, complete the requirements below and focus on the github practices outlined in the [README.md](https://github.com/QuinnManor/python-learning-club/blob/master/activities/README.md)

## Requirements
Write a program that accomplishes the following:
- Prints "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3
- Prints "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5
- Prints "Fizzbuzz" for numbers divisible by 3 and 5
- Prints the number for numbers not divisible by 3, 5, or 3 and 5
