# Roll Dice
This exercise focuses on sharpening our skills with **classes** and **object-oriented programming**. Complete the requirements below and continue getting comfortable with `git` and [Github](https://github.com/).

## Requirements
Create a `Dice` class that contains:
- A method called `roll_dice` that randomly rolls the dice and
- Two attributes: `min_roll` and `max_roll` 

and write a program that accomplishes the following:

- Prompts a user for there name
- Prompts a user to play, allowing them to quit if they decide
    - "press any key to play. press q to quit"
- Prints "Winner" if the dice combined to 11 points
- Prints "Craps" if the dice combines to 2, 3, or 12 points
