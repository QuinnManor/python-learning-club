# Bank Account
Let's continue working with classes by creating a Bank Account that accepts a users `name` and contains a starting `balance` of 0. Bank accounts have the ability to `deposit` and `withdrawl` funds in addition to checking if the balance is positive and if the withdrawl amount is enough. Once you've created the class, complete the requirements below.

## Requirements
Write an application that:
- Prompts a user for their name
- Prompts a user for an initial deposit
- Opens an account for the user, accepting their initial deposit
- Prompts them to shop at an online store with three potential items to purchase and an option to deposit more funds
- Outputs user can't afford an item when they're account is low
- After each purchase, prompts a user to continue shopping or to close their cart
